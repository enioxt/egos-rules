# DOMAIN RULES — EGOS Kernel

> **Version:** 2.1.0 | **Updated:** 2026-03-31
> **Project:** egos (orchestration-kernel + agent-runtime)

---

## How to Use

When a task touches a specific domain, load that domain's section
and apply its checklist BEFORE executing. Multiple domains can apply.

> **Note:** This file covers the **kernel repo** (`/home/enio/egos`).
> Leaf-repo-specific domains (egos-web, telegram-bot, eagle-eye, nexus)
> live in their own `DOMAIN_RULES.md` or inherit from `~/.egos/guarani/`.

## 1. AGENTIC PLATFORM

### SSOT

- **Agent registry:** `agents/registry/agents.json` (SSOT for all agents)
- **Agent runner:** `agents/runtime/runner.ts` (frozen zone)
- **Agent CLI:** `agents/cli.ts`
- **Agent implementations:** `agents/agents/*.ts`
- **Shared utils:** `packages/shared/src/` (llm-provider, model-router, types)

### Anti-Patterns

- Creating an agent without a registry entry
- Agent depending on external npm packages (zero-deps rule)
- Running `--exec` without first running `--dry`
- Duplicating logic that exists in `packages/shared/`
- Modifying `agents/runtime/runner.ts` without explicit approval

### Checklist

- [ ] Agent has registry entry in `agents.json` (id, name, description, path)
- [ ] Agent supports `--dry` mode (default)
- [ ] Agent produces structured JSON output
- [ ] Agent uses `packages/shared/src/llm-provider.ts` for AI calls
- [ ] Agent calls `routeForChat(taskType)` before LLM invocation
- [ ] Agent is idempotent (safe to re-run)
- [ ] Cost tracked per AI call
- [ ] PII masked in all output (CPF, email)

### Frozen Files

```
agents/runtime/runner.ts
agents/runtime/event-bus.ts
agents/registry/agents.json (structure, not content)
```

## 2. LLM PROVIDER & MODEL ROUTER

### SSOT

- **LLM client:** `packages/shared/src/llm-provider.ts`
- **Model router:** `packages/shared/src/model-router.ts`
- **Rate limiter:** `packages/shared/src/rate-limiter.ts`
- **Env vars:** `ALIBABA_DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`
- **Active providers:** DashScope (Alibaba Qwen), OpenRouter, Groq, HuggingFace
- **Reference:** `.env.example` for all expected keys

### Anti-Patterns

- Hardcoding a model name without going through `routeForChat()`
- Adding a new LLM provider without updating `MODEL_CATALOG`
- Calling APIs without checking `isAvailable()` first
- Ignoring cost tiers (using premium for bulk/cheap tasks)

### Checklist

- [ ] New model added to `MODEL_CATALOG` with accurate pricing
- [ ] Task type defined in `TaskType` union if new
- [ ] `.env.example` updated if new env key required
- [ ] End-to-end test with real API call passes
- [ ] Cost tracked in `AIAnalysisResult.cost_usd`

---

## 3. GOVERNANCE & SYNC

### SSOT

- **Governance DNA:** `.guarani/` (identity, orchestration, prompts, philosophy)
- **Sync script:** `scripts/governance-sync.sh` (kernel → `~/.egos` → leaf repos)
- **Shared home:** `~/.egos/` (guarani + workflows)
- **Downstream sync:** `~/.egos/sync.sh`
- **Legacy cleanup only:** `~/.egos/governance-symlink.sh` (manual remediation, not primary sync plane)
- **Repo-local surfaces:** `.windsurfrules`, `.guarani/IDENTITY.md`, `.guarani/PREFERENCES.md`
- **Governance check:** `bun run governance:check`

### Anti-Patterns

- Editing governance files in leaf repos instead of the kernel
- Forgetting to propagate after kernel edits
- Creating leaf-specific overrides that shadow kernel rules
- Using `governance-symlink.sh` as if it were the canonical propagation path
- Moving tool secrets or Claude/Codex user auth into repo-tracked config

### Checklist

- [ ] Change made in kernel `.guarani/` first
- [ ] Repo-local rule surfaces (`.windsurfrules`, `IDENTITY.md`, `PREFERENCES.md`) kept local unless a repo-role decision explicitly changes that policy
- [ ] `scripts/governance-sync.sh --exec` run after edits
- [ ] `~/.egos/sync.sh` propagated to all leaves
- [ ] User-scope tool secrets and MCP auth kept outside repo-tracked files
- [ ] `bun run governance:check` passes with 0 drift
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys

## 4. SECURITY

### SSOT

- **Pre-commit:** `scripts/security_scan.ts` + `scripts/ssot_governance.ts`
- **Frozen zones:** `agents/runtime/runner.ts`, `agents/runtime/event-bus.ts`, `.husky/`, `.guarani/orchestration/PIPELINE.md`
- **PII policy:** Mask CPF/email in ALL agent output
- **Prompt injection:** Sanitize external text before LLM
- **RLS:** Every new Supabase table MUST have RLS enabled

### Checklist

- [ ] No secrets in committed code (gitleaks clean)
- [ ] PII masked in logs and agent output
- [ ] External text sanitized before LLM calls
- [ ] RLS enabled on new tables
- [ ] Frozen zones untouched unless user-approved

---

## 5. SHARED PACKAGES

### SSOT

- **Path:** `packages/shared/src/`
- **LLM client:** `llm-provider.ts` (all AI calls go through here)
- **Model router:** `model-router.ts` (task-aware model selection)
- **Types:** `types.ts`
- **ATRiAN:** `atrian.ts` (ethical validation)
- **PII scanner:** `pii-scanner.ts`
- **Conversation memory:** `conversation-memory.ts`
- **Rate limiter:** `rate-limiter.ts`
- **Exports:** `index.ts` (barrel file)

### Anti-Patterns

- Duplicating logic that exists in shared packages
- Agent-specific code leaking into shared packages
- Breaking the llm-provider interface without updating all consumers
- Adding leaf-repo-specific utilities (OSINT, social, etc.) to shared

### Checklist

- [ ] New shared code is truly reusable (not agent-specific)
- [ ] TypeScript types exported via `index.ts`
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] `bun run typecheck` passes
- [ ] All consumers updated if interface changes

---

## 6. INTEGRATIONS & CHANNELS

### SSOT

- **Release contract:** `.guarani/orchestration/INTEGRATION_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md`
- **Contracts:** `integrations/_contracts/`
- **Manifests:** `integrations/manifests/`
- **Bundles:** `integrations/distribution/`
- **Gate:** `bun run integration:check`

### Anti-Patterns

- Calling an integration `validated` based only on a stub in `_contracts/`
- Documenting setup without a compact distribution artifact
- Shipping a bundle without `.env.example` when secrets are required
- Claiming runtime readiness without proof (`log`, `endpoint`, `runbook`, or equivalent)

### Checklist

- [ ] Manifest exists and is semver-valid
- [ ] SSOT, setup, and runbook refs are present
- [ ] Runtime proof is recorded
- [ ] Bundle exists in `integrations/distribution/<id>/`
- [ ] `validation.smokeCommand` passes
- [ ] `bun run integration:check` passes before merge/dissemination

---

## 6A. PRODUCT ROLLOUT & LAUNCH READINESS

### SSOT

- **Governance canon:** `.guarani/RULES_INDEX.md`
- **Execution standards:** `.guarani/PREFERENCES.md`
- **Task order / dependencies:** `TASKS.md`
- **Architecture / runbook:** domain SSOT doc (`docs/*_ARCHITECTURE*.md`, `docs/*SSOT*.md`, or equivalent)

### Anti-Patterns

- Bundling rollout work into opaque ranges (`SD-001..008`) without explicit dependency order
- Starting deploy without rollback path, smoke checks, and monitoring path
- Launching public surfaces before disclaimer/copy review and UX acceptance
- Treating `CLAUDE.md` or `.windsurfrules` as canonical when `.guarani` says otherwise

### Checklist

- [ ] Dependencies are explicit (`depends_on` or equivalent wording in TASKS.md)
- [ ] Exact execution order is named before implementation starts
- [ ] **Deploy gate** defined: health check, smoke check, monitoring path, rollback path
- [ ] **Security gate** defined: secrets/env handling, PII/log policy, access model, disclaimers
- [ ] **UX gate** defined: onboarding, empty/error states, copy review, acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Launch gate** defined: ICP/persona, analytics path, feedback loop, GTM/dissemination handoff

## 7. SSOT VISIT PROTOCOL (Cross-Repo AND Intra-Repo)

**Rule:** Whenever you visit a file that is contextually distant — either in another repo OR deep inside the current repo (archive/, docs/, legacy/, old/, >2 directories from CWD) — you MUST log the visit. Large repos have "lost gems": files created, forgotten, never referenced again. Logging prevents silent drift.

### When to Log (Triggers)

**Cross-repo** (other repos under /home/enio/):
- Any file read outside the current working repo

**Intra-repo** (same repo, contextually distant):
- File in `archive/`, `docs/`, `legacy/`, `old/`, `_current_handoffs/`
- File more than 2 directory levels from the working root
- File not referenced in TASKS.md, AGENTS.md, or SYSTEM_MAP.md
- File discovered via search/grep (not directly navigated to)
- File not committed in >30 days AND you read its content

### Protocol Steps

1. **LOG the visit** in the nearest `TASKS.md` with format:
   ```
   - [x] SSOT-VISIT [date]: [path-or-repo/path] → read [what] → [disposition]
   ```
2. **MARK the source** — If it's a doc, add to its header:
   `<!-- SSOT-VISITED: YYYY-MM-DD, disposition: [tag] -->`
3. **MARK duplicates** — Add a comment: `<!-- DUPLICATE: canonical at [path] -->`
   and create a task to resolve.
4. **ARCHIVE after extraction** — Aspirational/wrong docs → `archive/` + TASKS.md entry.
5. **NEVER leave a visit unlogged.** Missing log = governance violation.

### Disposition Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|----|---------|
| `archived` | Moved to `archive/` in source repo |
| `merged` | Content absorbed into target, source deleted or noted |
| `kept-as-ref` | Source kept but not canonical — target is SSOT |
| `superseded` | Source was wrong/outdated — replaced by target |
| `independent` | Both are canonical for different purposes |
| `gem-found` | Hidden valuable content surfaced, extracted to active use |
| `stale-confirmed` | Visited, confirmed outdated, left as-is with note |

### Applies to
- `/start`: scan all repos → log SSOT gaps + any gems found
- `/end`: verify ALL visits this session are logged before closing
- `/disseminate`: log which files were propagated where
- Pre-commit: warn if staged files reference paths not in visit log
- Any Agent/Explore task that searches multiple directories
- Manual exploration: if you read a file deep in the tree, log it

### Example Log Entries
```
- [x] SSOT-VISIT 2026-03-30: carteira-livre/docs/project_eagle_eye.md → original Eagle Eye spec → kept-as-ref
- [x] SSOT-VISIT 2026-03-30: egos-lab/apps/eagle-eye/docs/ → 5 aspirational docs → archived
- [x] SSOT-VISIT 2026-03-30: egos/docs/concepts/architecture/FRACTAL_GROWTH.md → gem-found: brand.egos.ia.br vision → merged to memory
- [x] SSOT-VISIT 2026-03-30: egos/packages/shared/src/social/ai-engine.ts → gem-found: created as shim → independent
```
